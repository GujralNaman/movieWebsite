# MY MOVIE WEBSITE :)

I've developed the frontEnd of an OTT plattform which includes various pages including :- Homepage, Contact Us, Login/ SignUp Page and even 404 Page. (Page not found)
The website is responsive and works quite well on different Screen Sizes.
*************
The Contact Us form data will get saved and the admin got the responses via email. It is basically a kind of database storage for the contact us form. The part that is not yet available, the server redirects it to a cool 404 page which is also developed by me.
************
We also have a cool login/SignUp page which have a scrolling animation feature which looks very trending.



## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Fullscreen mode
- Cool Carousel
- Hover Effect
- Fully Functional & Deployed
- The admin get the saved data of the Contact Us form via mail.
